The steps I imagine it'd take to complete this bot:

[x] First of all, see if it can access messages of a group from the very top or not.
-- So the answer is 'no', we can't with our normal bot, we'd need a userbot and python to do this stuff.

[x] Trying out manual exports if we really want to train our AI with all the older messages.
[x] formatting the exported JSON data for making it simple to work with.

[x] create database, get running with it!
[] create typescript models so I save myself pain in the long-run
[] get a keyword extractor

[] observe with the bot and gather message data
[] format it so it matches my exported schema

[] make the context aware logic
[] have it send the GPT generated response in chat
