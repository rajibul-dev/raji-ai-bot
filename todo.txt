The steps I imagine it'd take to complete this bot:

[x] First of all, see if it can access messages of a group from the very top or not.
-- So the answer is 'no', we can't with our normal bot, we'd need a userbot and python to do this stuff.

[x] Trying out manual exports if we really want to train our AI with all the older messages.
[x] formatting the exported JSON data for making it simple to work with.
